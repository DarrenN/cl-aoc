* Advent of Code in Common Lisp (SBCL)

** Usage

- Years namespaced by folders: =src/<year>/<day>.lisp=
- Each day is it's own package: =CL-AOC/<YEAR>/<DAY>=
- Tests? Maybe, but don't count on 'em

Example (in your sly/slime repl):

#+begin_src lisp
  (in-package :cl-aoc/2024/day1)
  (1a)
#+end_src

** Installation

Clone repo to your =local-projects= or equivalent, then use ASDF or Quicklisp.

#+begin_src lisp
  (ql:quickload :cl-aoc)
#+end_src
